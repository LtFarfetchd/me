# Me!

This is the codebase for Adam's experimental resume website. Feel free to explore!

# TODOs:

## BugFixes:

- when clicking on `GradientMenuItem`s, have it scroll so that the top of the section is below the bottom of the menu container
- make sure the `GradientMenu` doesn't activate `GradientMenuItem`s as it scrolls through them after clicks
- switch large values creating circular border radii to `50%` values

## Improvements:

- on-click state for `GradientButton`
- refactor repeated values into constants wherever possible (full audit)

## Components:

- dark/light mode?
- styled itch.io game link embed
